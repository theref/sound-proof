# SoundProof MVP üéµ

A Farcaster-native music discovery platform where listeners pay once (‚âà3¬¢) to own tracks forever and discover tomorrow's artists today.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Farcaster-Only Authentication**: Sign in with your Farcaster identity
- **Social Music Discovery**: Discover tracks through your Farcaster network
- **Local Storage**: Simple MVP storage without database complexity  
- **IPFS Storage**: Permanent, decentralized file storage via Lighthouse
- **TACo Encryption**: Optional track encryption with threshold access control
- **Rich Profiles**: Leverage Farcaster social data and verified addresses

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Lighthouse API Key** - Get from [lighthouse.storage](https://lighthouse.storage/)
2. **Neynar API Key** - Get from [neynar.com](https://neynar.com/) for Farcaster integration
3. **Farcaster Account** - Create at [warpcast.com](https://warpcast.com/)

### Setup

1. **Clone and Install**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd sound-proof
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys:
   # VITE_LIGHTHOUSE_API_KEY=your_lighthouse_api_key
   # VITE_NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_api_key
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Visit** http://localhost:8080

5. **Enable Testing** (optional): Visit http://localhost:8080?debug=true for built-in test tools

## üß™ Testing Farcaster Integration

To verify your Farcaster setup is working:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure `VITE_NEYNAR_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. **Test User Lookup**: Try signing in with a known Farcaster username
3. **Verify Wallet Connection**: Ensure the wallet you're connecting has a verified address on your Farcaster profile
4. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any API errors during authentication

### Common Issues

- **"Farcaster user not found"**: Double-check the username spelling (no @ symbol)
- **"Wallet not verified"**: Go to warpcast.com/~/settings/verified-addresses and add your wallet
- **"API key not found"**: Ensure environment variables are properly loaded (restart dev server)
- **Network errors**: Check your Neynar API key permissions and rate limits
